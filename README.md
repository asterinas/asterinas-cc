Welcome to Asterinas Confidential Computing (Asterinas-CC). Asterinas Confidential Computing is a collection of open-source projects featuring full-stack capabilities in confidential computing. Our goal is to provide users with powerful and flexible solutions for confidential and privacy-preserving computing, ensuring the security and privacy of data during processing.

# Introduction

The Asterinas Confidential Computing builds a complete confidential computing ecosystem based on three core open source projects: HyperEnclave, Occlum, and TrustFlow.

[**HyperEnclave**](https://github.com/asterinas/hyperenclave) is an open, cross-platform Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that provides a hardware-level protected and isolated computing environment while decoupling its root of trust from the CPU vendor.

[**Occlum**](https://github.com/asterinas/occlum) is a lightweight TEE operating system that supports multiple mainstream programming languages and file systems, enabling confidential computing applications to easily leverage existing development skills and resources.

[**TrustFlow**](https://github.com/asterinas/trustflow) focuses on constructing a trusted data flow and computing framework, ensuring the security and privacy of data during its transfer.

These components work together to create a full-stack solution that spans from underlying hardware support to upper-layer applications, meeting the confidential and privacy computing needs across various scenarios.
